 This is a fullstack E-commerce store. The frontend uses the React.js framework and is coded in TypeScript. The frontend additionally makes use of the Bootswatch for styling and the Ion-Icons CDN for the icons in the NavBar, product view pages, and shopping cart. Redux is also used to keep state in the front end.

When it came to sending state down to multiple product view pages and combining data into a single shopping cart page, Redux came in handy. The application uses several Redux actions and reducers, each of which corresponds to separate features: fetching initial data from the Node.js API and adding and altering Cartitems.


Throughout the framework, there are a number of JavaScript methods that perform duties such as deciding which components to render, calculating shopping cart totals, and handling the numerous DOM events involved in the application.


Overall, this was a difficult project that challenged me to learn and master difficult concepts like establishing a multiple API endpoints, utilizing Redux to store and send down state, and implementing logic functions to handle data on the frontend.
